Wallmart - Supply chain dashboard. It's my first published Power BI report. 
I started creating it during my studies on course "Techics of effective communication of results".

I received "Wallmart - Supply chain dashboard.xlsx" containing sheet: "Wallmart" with columns:
Column A - Order ID
Column B - Order Date
Column C - Ship Date
Column D - Customer Name
Column E - Country
Column F - City
Column G - State
Column H - Category (product category of saled product)
Column I - Product Name
Column J - Sales
Column K - Quantity
Column L - Profit
