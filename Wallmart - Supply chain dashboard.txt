Wallmart - Supply chain dashboard. It's my first published Power BI report. 
I started creating it during my studies on course "Techics of effective communication of results".

Column E - Country
Column F - City
Column G - State
Column H - Category (product category of saled product)
Column I - Product Name
Column J - Sales
Column K - Quantity
Column L - Profit

Sheet "Month" contains columns:
Column A - Month No. (month numer)
Column B - Month Name

Sheet "Goals" contains columns:
